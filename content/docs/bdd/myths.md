subtitle: Common misunderstandings and myths about BDD

# Myth: You can pick and choose the practices in any order

* if you've NOT already done discovery work -> formulate scenarios is a waste of time
* if you have NOT figured out the most important examples to automate -> you can NOT automate examples

# Myth: You can automate scenarios after the code is implemented

* test automation
  * == FIRST implement & afterward creating test
  * ⚠️!= BDD ⚠️
  * -- can be done via -- Cucumber
  * allows
    * checking bugs after

# Myth: Discovery doesn't need a conversation

* == identify examples / -- turning them into formulated -- scenarios  -- left to a -- 1! individual
  * ⚠️!= BDD ⚠️
* Discovery work -- needs to be done -- _collaboratively_

# Myth: Using Cucumber means you're doing BDD

* use Cucumber != doing BDD
* [BDD is more than JUST using Cucumber](/docs/bdd)
